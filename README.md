# **User Guide** ðŸ“„

Welcome to AIUB Blood Donation Club, an application designed to connect donors and recipients for blood donations. In this user guide, we'll take you through the features of the app and how to use them.

## **Getting Started**

To use the application, you need to create an account. If you're a first-time user, click the "Register" button and provide your details such as your name, email, password, AIUB ID, and blood group. If you have already registered, simply log in using your AIUB ID and password.

### **Home**

After logging in, you will be directed to the home page. From here, you can access all the features of the application.

### **Request Blood -** Dashboard(Recipient)

If you need blood, you can create a post by clicking on the "Request Blood" button. In the post, you need to provide details such as location, date, time, and blood group. Once you create a post, it will appear on your profile, and only you and available donors can view it. You can edit the post or delete it before it is closed if you want.

### **Donate Blood**

If you are a donor, you can view all the available posts on the newsfeed. You can view the details of the post, such as location, date, time, and blood group. If you are eligible to donate blood, you can apply to donate by clicking on the "Donate Blood" button. Once you apply to donate blood, your name will appear in the list of donors for that post, and only the recipient and donors with matching blood groups can view the post.

### Dashboard(Donor)

The newsfeed displays all the available open posts for donation. Open posts are visible to the owner of the post and donors with matching blood groups. You can view the details of the post, such as location, date, time, blood group, and the number of required bags. Closed posts are not visible on the newsfeed.

### **Find Donor**

If you cannot find a donor for your request, you can use the "Find Donor" page to search for donors. You can search for donors based on their blood group. This feature is available for both (Donor and Recipient).

### **Contact Donor**

If a donor has already donated to your request, you can see a "Contact Donor" button that redirects you to the donor's profile. From there, you can contact the donor to thank them or request further help.

### **My Requests**

After making a request, recipients can see all their requests on the "My Requests" page. You can view the details of your requests, such as the number of bags required, the date and time of the request, and the status of the request (open or closed).

### **My Donations**

After donating blood, donors can see all their donations on the "My Donations" page. You can view the details of your donations, such as the recipient's name, the number of bags donated, the date and time of the donation, and the status of the donation (accepted or rejected).

### **Logout**

Once you are done using the application, you can log out by clicking on the "Logout" button.
